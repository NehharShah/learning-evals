# General Coding Principles

## Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow established patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use consistent naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## TypeScript Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper typing
- Avoid `any` type - use specific types or `unknown` with type guards
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use type assertions sparingly and only when necessary

## Documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document API endpoints with proper schemas
- Keep README files updated with current setup procedures
- Document complex business logic and architectural decisions

## Git and Development
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use proper branch naming conventions (feature/, fix/, docs/)
- Review code before merging
